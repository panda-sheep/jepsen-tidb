# jepsen.tidb

A Clojure library designed to test [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb) with [Jepsen](https://github.com/aphyr/jepsen).

## Usage

Jepsen supports two ways to run, LXC or docker. you can see the jepsen document for more help.

We support origin Jepsen docker in docker mode, and at the same time, we support running multi dockers too. 

### docker in docker

`./run_dind.sh`

### multi dockers

`./run_multi.sh`

You can use `./stop_multi.sh` to stop all running contains.

After you enter docker jepsen, run:

+ `cd /jepsen_tidb`
+ `lein test`

Notice:

If you are in China, the `apt-get` may be very slow because of the poor Chinese network. 

Before you run the `lein test`, run `/jepsen_tidb/docker/update_sources.sh`, 
this will replace the origin official debian source with [163's](http://mirrors.163.com/.help/debian.html).
